We decided to create a database of a bookstore.
It has 4 tables: orders, customers, books, date, with the corresponding data.
On the stage level, we cleaned the data and made sure all the values are valid.
Then we kept customers, books, and date as dimensional tables, while orders was turned into a fact table by joining with others.
Our DWH has 3 levels: raw, stage, and mart.
